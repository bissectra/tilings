# Tiling of the Plane with Regular Polygons

This repository features a unique tiling of the plane with regular polygons, showcasing all vertex types except for the 4-8-8 configuration. Special thanks to Samy Meziane for providing this remarkable example.

## Visualizing the Tiling and Its Duals

### Higher-Order Dual Tilings

The process of deriving duals can be repeated indefinitely. Below are the visualizations up to the 15th-order dual:
